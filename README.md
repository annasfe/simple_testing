# Simple exercise to practise testing with JEST

- Download code
- Go to the downloaded folder and run "npm install" to install the dependencies
- Go to the test folder and check what the tests describe before you build your code
- Build the functionality so that the tests pass! Remember you need to run "npm run test" to run the tests

## NOTE
- start from sumArray which is easier, it should be a function that sums all array items and returns the number of the summary.
- then go to the lettercount function, that is a function that takes a string as an input and returns an object, with a key-value pair of each letter of the string vs the occurences of this letter of the string. (example "hello" should return {h:1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1})
