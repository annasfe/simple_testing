# Simple exercise to practise testing with JEST

- Download code
- Go to the downloaded folder and run "npm install" to install the dependencies
- Go to the test folder and check what the tests describe before you build your code
- Go to the src folder and build the functionality so that the tests pass! Remember you need to run "npm run test" to run the tests
- Add more tests if you like!

## NOTE
sumArray is a function that sums all array items and returns the summary.
